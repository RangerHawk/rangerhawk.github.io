## üå± What Is Gimpinator EX?

Gimpinator EX is a plugin that lets you generate AI images directly inside GIMP using text prompts.  
It supports Stable Horde (free distributed backend) and optional local model scaffolding.

## üì¶ Installation Guide (Beginner-Friendly)

### 1. Download the Plugin

Go to: https://github.com/PCOW/Gimpinator  
Click the green box that says ‚ÄúCode‚Äù and select ‚ÄúDownload ZIP‚Äù

### 2. Unzip and Move

Extract the ZIP to:  
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins
This will create a folder named "Gimpinator-main" inside the plugins folder. Please rename this folder to "Gimpinator_ex"

**Note:**  
Inside this download you will find a file named `gimpinator_ex.py`. You will need to edit this file.  
(Suggested editing with Notepad++ https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/, but Windows Notepad will work fine.)

The USERNAME in this file is incorrect. Near the top of the file you will find a line:  
`sys.path.append(r"C:\Users\OlafW\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib\site-packages")`  
Replace `OlafW` or `USERNAME` with your actual Windows username.

To find your Windows username:  
Open Command Prompt ‚Üí type: `echo %USERNAME%` ‚Üí press Enter  
Use the name it displays to replace "OlafW" or "USERNAME" in the plugin file.

If you have not already done so, please rename the folder that you extracted the plugin to from "Gimpinator-main" to "Gimpinator_ex" The plugin itself was created to use this directory structure and will not work otherwise. Whomever created the zip file missed this detail.

Inside that folder, confirm you have:  
‚Ä¢ gimpinator_ex.py  
‚Ä¢ gimpinator_config.json (optional)

This optional config file stores your Stable Horde API key. It does not connect to GitHub.  
If it‚Äôs missing, you can create one manually using the instructions below.

### 3. Check File Permissions

Right-click each file ‚Üí Properties  
‚Ä¢ Uncheck ‚ÄúRead-only‚Äù  
‚Ä¢ Click ‚ÄúUnblock‚Äù if present  
Apply and repeat for all plugin files (.py)

### 4. Create Config File (Optional for Stable Horde)

To use Stable Horde, you‚Äôll need a free API key.

How to get one:

- Click "Login" in the top right  
- Sign in using Discord, GitHub, or another method  
- Click your username ‚Üí go to "Account"  
- Scroll down to find your API key and copy it

### 5. Create the Config File

- Open Notepad or Notepad++  
- Paste this into the file (replace `your-key-here` with your actual API key):  
`{ "api_key": "your-key-here", "default_model": "SDXL", "default_sampler": "k_dpmpp_2m" }`  
- Click File ‚Üí Save As  
- Name the file: `gimpinator_config.json`  
- Set "Save as type" to "All Files"  
- Save it inside the `Gimpinator_ex` folder

### 6. Install Python

Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
Install Python 3.10 or higher  
Check ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù during setup

### 7. Verify Python Installation

Open Command Prompt ‚Üí type: `where python`  
This will show you where Python is installed.
